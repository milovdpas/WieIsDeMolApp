## Introduction
When I was watching a YouTube video, I heard a song that was on SoundCloud. But the song name was not mentioned in the description or comments. So than I tried to find the song with Shazam, but it was no use. I could not find it with Shazam, so then I searched for an alternative online. But there was no alternative, so that's when I decided to make my own app to solve this problem.

This project was made for a test application that can be used to detect SoundCloud songs using the microphone of the phone.
Currently, the application is only tested for Android, if someone with a Mac wants to test the project and make iOS work I would really appreciate that. You can then open a PR and I will review it.
